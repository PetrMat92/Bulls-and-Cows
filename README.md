#Title
Bulls&Cows

#Description
This is a simple Python game based on the classic Bulls&Cows game. The game generates a random 4-digit number with unique digits from 0 to 9. The player's task is to guess the secret number. For every guess, the game provides feedback in the form of the number of "bulls" and "cows". Bulls are the number of correct digits in the correct position, while cows are the number of correct digits in the wrong position. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

#Requirements
This code requires the following packages:

pyfiglet
timeit
datetime

#Usage
To play the game, simply run the 'Bulls&cows.py' file in your Python environment. The game will start with a welcome message and instructions. You will be prompted to input a 4-digit number with unique digits, and the game will provide feedback in the form of the number of bulls and cows for every guess. The game will continue until you guess the correct number.
